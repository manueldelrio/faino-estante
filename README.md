# Faino Estante. A DIWO Shelving System

![faino estante front](https://github.com/manueldelrio/faino-estante/blob/develop/files/fainoestante_front.png)

Faino Estante is a fully customizable shelving system. It's based on a grid structure whose dimensions can be adapted to user's needs. The entire system is designed to be manufactured by means of discrete production oriented machines and tools, that is, by using industrial processes that make single-piece manufacturing economically viable.

The core of this shelving system consists of **side frames** in welded square steel tube, joined together by **cross beams** made of folded sheet steel. Board **shelves** rest on that stringers and close the basic structure. Several **accesories** -such as full-height containers, drawers, boxes, trays, book/vinyl brackets- can be added to the core configuration.

All modelling work is hosted into a Work-in-Progress [Onshape Document](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d7ff6031ddc7554d73ed1af8/w/cea366a2ab38cc04bef6ae4f/e/82c43c866d6ae67849fae132).

## Design

The core of the system follows three main premises:
* **Discreet.** Or as Dieter Rams says: *as little design as possible*. Bookshelves used to be high-sized furniture, so design must minimize its visual weight.

* **Designed to last.** Books weigh,so a good mechanic resistance is required, specially on high span configurations. Easy repairability and reconfigurability (new uses, new spaces) are another key features took in mind during design process.

* **Intended for discrete manufacturing.** Digital manufacturing processes such as laser cutting or CNC machining makes feasible single-unit production without boost costs, and nowadays these technologies are wide-extended, so it's easy to find it on near manufacturers. Anyway, it's easy to adapt design to a more classical manufacturing processes.

The design solution starts from an archetypical shelving configuration: Side frames for vertical growth and a combination of beams and shelves for horizontal development. This so Cartesian configuration allows to focus attention on empty spaces and divert it from the grid.

Assymmetric-U-section cross beams are system's cornerstone, contributing to a good mechanical resistance, hiding fixations and visually enlighting the shelves.

The result is a visually clean shelf whether viewed from above or from below.
