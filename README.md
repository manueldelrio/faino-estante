# Faino Estante. A DIWO Shelving System.

Faino Estante is a fully customizable shelving system. It's based on a grid structure whose dimensions can be adapted to user's needs. The entire system is designed to be manufactured by means of discrete production oriented machines and tools, that is, by using industrial processes that make single-piece manufacturing economically viable.

The core of this shelving system consists of **side frames** in welded square steel tube, joined together by **cross beams** made of folded sheet steel. Board **shelves** rest on that stringers and close the basic structure. Several **accesories** -such as full-height containers, drawers, boxes, trays, book/vinyl brackets- can be added to the core configuration.
