# Faino Estante. A DIWO Shelving System

![faino estante front](https://github.com/manueldelrio/faino-estante/blob/develop/files/fainoestante_front.png)

Faino Estante is a fully customizable shelving system. It's based on a grid structure whose dimensions can be adapted to user's needs. The entire system is designed to be manufactured by means of discrete production oriented machines and tools, that is, by using industrial processes that make single-piece manufacturing economically viable.

The core of this shelving system consists of **side frames** in welded square steel tube, joined together by **cross beams** made of folded sheet steel. Board **shelves** rest on that stringers and close the basic structure. Several **accesories** -such as full-height containers, drawers, boxes, trays, book/vinyl brackets- can be added to the core configuration.

The design is published under a **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License** and is modeled parametrically on open access **[document hosted on the Onshape platform](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d7ff6031ddc7554d73ed1af8/w/93216ba0c772718d4a92892b/e/82c43c866d6ae67849fae132)**. This means that anyone can access them, make a copy and adapt the design to their needs and the means of production available: change the dimensions to suit their requirements, remove or add components and change the design to adapt the manufacture to other materials or production processes. Onshape document is a work-in-progress file, but exported 3D parts and 2D drawing files are stored into [files](https://github.com/manueldelrio/faino-estante/tree/master/files) folder.

## Design

The core of the system follows three main premises:
* **Discreet.** Or as Dieter Rams says: *as little design as possible*. Bookshelves used to be high-sized furniture, so design must minimize its visual weight.

* **Designed to last.** Books weigh,so a good mechanic resistance is required, specially on high span configurations. Easy repairability and reconfigurability (new uses, new spaces) are another key features took in mind during design process.

* **Intended for discrete manufacturing.** Digital manufacturing processes such as laser cutting or CNC machining makes feasible single-unit production without boost costs, and nowadays these technologies are wide-extended, so it's easy to find it on near manufacturers. Anyway, it's easy to adapt design to a more classical manufacturing processes.

The design solution starts from an archetypical shelving configuration: Side frames for vertical growth and a combination of beams and shelves for horizontal development. This so Cartesian configuration allows to focus attention on empty spaces and divert it from the grid.

Assymmetric-U-section cross beams are system's cornerstone, contributing to a good mechanical resistance, hiding fixations and visually enlighting the shelves.

The result is a visually clean shelf whether viewed from above or from below.

## Do It With Others, or Distributed Manufacturing
Keeping in mind digital manufacturing technologies during design process enables distributed manufacturing ecosystems.

Unlike traditional manufacturing, where raw materials are transformed into standarized products in centralized factories and distributed to customers, distributed manufacturing focus on customized single-unit on-demand products, manufactured according to user needs and preferences. Production is distributed into a network of factories, workshops and craftmans working in closely communication with final user.

Three key roles are defined: 
* **User** must adopt an active role in shelf design, transmitting to the designer all critical information in order to ensure that the design meets her/his needs.
* **Manufacturer** is a professional or organization with capacity to resolve one or more production processes involved in shelving system manufacturing.
* **Designer** acts as a link between user and manufacturers. He has the responsability of adapt shelf design to user's needs and preferences while keep it suitable for available manufacturers' capabilities.
