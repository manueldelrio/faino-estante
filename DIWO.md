Three main roles are defined in [README.md](https://github.com/manueldelrio/faino-estante/blob/develop/README.md) to carry out the development and manufacture of the bookshelf, but this doesn't mean that they correspond to three different subjects. *User*, *designer* and *manufacturer* rather refer to three main sets of functions or tasks: demand, interpretation and adaptation for manufacturing, and execution. The user or the manufacturer can assume the functions of the designer if they have the necessary knowledge, it may also be the case that the user and the manufacturer are the same person but they need a designer to help them solve the design with greater solvency (remember that surely more than one manufacturer will be needed in the execution of the shelf).

Obviously, the main role is the one who needs a bookcase: the user. He/she must take an active position in the ideation, understanding what specific needs the shelving must meet and how it fits into the space in which it's going to be installed (it is not just a matter of dimensions, all furniture in a given space must dialogue in harmony).

The function of the designer is to collect all the information given by the user, analyze available means of production and adapt the design according to those circumstances. But how do you know if you are qualified to assume the role of designer? Well, if you understand everything described in [DESIGN.md](https://github.com/manueldelrio/faino-estante/blob/develop/DESIGN.md) you can assume it perfectly, but for the adaptation of the design you can go in several ways:

1. If you know how to use Onshape you can make a copy of the document and adapt the design.
2. If you use another 2D or 3D CAD program you can import the corresponding documents and change the documents or model from scratch. All the keys to the design are in design.md and in the plans.
3. You can also go directly to the manufacturers with the original drawings and explain the changes you want to make to the original design to adapt it to your needs. In this case, it is the manufacturers who assume the role of designer. If you choose this route, you must make sure that what each of the manufacturers is going to execute is compatible with what the others manufacture.

However, being a designer is not just being skillful at drawing and modeling or knowing a lot about materials and manufacturing processes. A designer will ask - and ask you - questions that you had not even asked yourself and will reach conclusions that will improve the final result of the design.
